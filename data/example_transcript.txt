John: Good morning everyone. Let's start with the status update.
Sarah: Hi John. I've completed the database schema design. The approval from the security team is still pending.
John: Thanks Sarah. Can you follow up with them by end of this week?
Sarah: Sure, I'll send them a reminder email today.
Mike: I have the API documentation draft ready. Someone needs to review it before we can publish.
John: Mike, can you send it to the docs team? They'll review by next Tuesday.
Mike: Will do. Should I include the error code reference?
John: Yes, definitely. That's critical for developers.
Sarah: Also, we need to schedule the user testing session. I'm thinking sometime in mid-February.
John: Sarah, can you book the conference room and send calendar invites? Aim for February 10th if possible.
Sarah: Got it. I'll coordinate with the team and send out the invites tomorrow.
Mike: One more thing - the deployment to staging needs to happen this Friday.
John: Right. Mike, make sure all tests pass before pushing to staging.
Mike: Already on it. Expecting to finish by Thursday evening.
John: Perfect. Sarah, can you prepare the release notes?
Sarah: Of course. I'll have them ready by Friday morning for review.
